A simple Desktop Application for controlling media related functionalities on a computer similar to the dedicated media keys on a Laptop. Its made in Python using the PyQt5 module.

I made this app in order to serve the same functionality which the dedicated keys on a Laptop serve. This app contains 6 universal media buttons.

For running this app, install the following Python modules:-
1. pyqt5
2. pyqt5-tools
3. pynput
